  # ⚽ Sport App
  
  **A football leagues & teams browser built with the Next.js App Router.**
  
  Browse competitions from around the world, drill into any league to see its teams,
  and open a team to view its stadium, description and official links — all powered by
  [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/) and served with background data caching.

## ✨ Features

- **Browse leagues** — every league from TheSportsDB, laid out in a responsive card grid.
- **Instant search** — filter leagues as you type, fully client-side and case-insensitive.
- **Dynamic routing** — `/leagues/[leagueId]` and `/leagues/[leagueId]/teams/[teamId]` build league and team pages on demand.
- **Rich team pages** — badge, stadium, country, an expandable description (`ReadMore`) and official **website / Facebook / Instagram** links.
- **Proper UX states** — dedicated `loading`, `error` and `not-found` screens using the App Router's file conventions.
- **Cached data fetching** — responses are revalidated with ISR (`revalidate: 86400` / `3600`), so pages stay fast without serving stale data.
- **Typed end-to-end** — `League`, `Team` and API-response interfaces keep the data layer safe.
- **Accessible & responsive** — a labelled search input and a 1 → 2 → 3 column layout across breakpoints.

## 🧱 Tech stack

## 🔌 How the data layer works

All network calls live in [`src/app/lib/api.ts`](src/app/lib/api.ts) and wrap TheSportsDB's free endpoints:

| Helper | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getAllLeagues()` | `all_leagues.php` | League list for the home page |
| `getTeamsByLeagues(id)` | `lookup_all_teams.php` | Teams inside a league |
| `getTeamsByLeague(name)` | `search_all_teams.php` | Teams by league name |
| `getPlayersByTeam(id)` | `lookup_all_players.php` | Players for a team |

Each request uses Next.js caching (`next: { revalidate }`), so data is regenerated in the background instead of re-fetched on every visit.

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Majkan1/Sport-app.git
cd Sport-app

# 2. Install
npm install

# 3. Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> No API key or `.env` is required — the app uses TheSportsDB's free public tier.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

## 🧭 Roadmap

- [ ] Player rosters on team pages (the `getPlayersByTeam` helper is already in place)
- [ ] Favourite leagues persisted in `localStorage`
- [ ] Filter leagues by country / sport
- [ ] Unit & component tests (Jest + Testing Library are already configured)
- [ ] Image optimisation with `next/image`
